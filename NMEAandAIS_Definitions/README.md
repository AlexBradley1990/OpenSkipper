The files N0183Defns.N0183Dfn.xml and PGNDefns.N2kDfn.xml are an attempt to document, in a code friendly fashion, the rules by which NMEA 0183 and NMEA 2000 messages are decoded to extract the data values being transmitted. These files are unofficial in that they are not supported nor promoted by the NMEA organisation (www.nmea.org). These files have not been constructed using any information obtained as a result of collaboration with the NMEA association, and do not contain any information provided as a result of the signing of any non-disclosure agreements.

# Kees Defns.xml

The PGNDefns file is based on information provided by Kees Verjuit in the file "Kees Defns.xml" which is produced by Kees Verruijt's PacketLogger and can be imported and translated by Open SKipper. Some ad-hoc interpretation is performed by Open Skipper to add further information needed by Open Skipper but not given in Kees's file. See http://www.keversoft.com/Packetlogger.html

# AIS.AISDfn.xml

This file describes how AIS messages transmitted over NMEA 0183 should be decoded. It is based on information provided at web sites such as:

# Editting in Open Skipper

Open Skipper contains embedded versions of these files which are used by default. These files can be editted and saved to disk, with Open Skipper then being able to use the updated files.
